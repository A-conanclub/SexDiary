# Project introduction

This project is to use the Python programming language to build a software called "SexDiary", which aims to record every sex life and related information. The initial construction is based on the Windows system as the main platform, and it will be transferred to the Android platform after the initial success and maturity of the project. At the same time, this project is the first project for programming beginners, and there will inevitably be bugs and bloated code, and the project progress time is uncertain.
